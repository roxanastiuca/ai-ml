    "**Unigrame:**\n",
    "- E o varianta echilibrata, cu ambele valori (blue si rouge) in jurul lui 0.6. Asta inseamna (aproximativ) ca pastreaza 60% din propozitiile care aparea si in \"ground truth\", dar 40% din propozitii/tokeni sunt \"in plus\".\n",
    "- Desi nu se modifica semnificativ, observam ca prin eliminarea stop words, atat blue, cat si rouge, scad. Asta ar putea fi pentru ca , cuvintele stop alese nu sunt corecte si au o semnificatie in textele respective. Textele reprezinta niste stiri, menite publicului larg, si includ multe cuvinte simple si usor de inteles, pe care poate spacy le-a considerat nesemnificative, dar ele influentau usor performantele.\n",
    "- Prin lematizare, creste usor valoarea recall (rouge) deci sunt pastrate in rezumat mai multe propozitii relevante, dar blue scade usor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bigrame:**\n",
    "- Au o precizie mai mare decat varianta cu unigrame, dar un recall mai mic. Insemna ca pastreaza mai putine propozitii, dar acestea se regasesc in cele corecte cu un procent mai bun (~70%).\n",
    "- Prin eliminarea stop words, blue creste cu 5 procente, pentru ca bigramele formate sunt mai relevante.\n",
    "- Prin lematizare, precizia scade usor. Poate forma specifica a unor cuvinte era relevanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4-grame:**\n",
    "- Are cea mai buna precizie (aproape 90%). Tokenii formati din 4 cuvinte sunt mult mai specifici si clasifica mai corect propozitiile in relevante/nerelevante. Recall este in acelasi range de valori ca pentru unigrame si bigrame, iar valoarea de 0.5 poate insemna ca ar fi nevoie de mai multe propozitii incluse in rezumat.\n",
    "- Eliminarea stop words duce la o precizie cu 15 procente mai mica pentru ca exista multe propozitii scurte, care prin eliminarea aceasta, devin si mai mici si uneori nu au nici 4 cuvinte pentru formarea unei 4-grame, deci nu reusesc sa influenteze corect parametrii modelului."

    "#### Observatii\n",
    "- Se observa in general o precizie scazuta (multe variante cu <0.5), dar un recall foarte mare pentru jumatate din variante. Acest lucru se datoreaza faptului ca acest model impune includerea a unui numar strict de propozitii (30% din nr. de propozitii din textul original) chiar daca unele poate au un scor prea mic ca sa fie relevante.\n",
    "- Valorile pentru variantele cu acelasi n in n-grame sunt asemanatoare, folosirea doar a substantivelor si ponderarea similitudinii cu titlu aducand o usoara crestere pentru blue si rouge. Singura tehnica , care schimba mult performantele, pentru 4-grame, este folosirea pozitiei in text. Este din cauza ca, multe propozitii sunt scurte si asa ca uneori nici nu returneaza nicio 4-grama, iar potrivirea a 4 cuvinte consecutive cu titlul e putin probabile, asa ca singura metrica care influenteaza mult scorul unei propozitii este pozitia in text. Dar aceasta singura nu e suficient pentru a clasifica corect propozitia. "

      "b'Concerns at school diploma plan\\n\\nFinal appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England\\'s secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.\\n\\nThe government\\'s response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.\\n\\nHis main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA\\'s concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.\\n\\nThe chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I\\'m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it\\'s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don\\'t say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers\\' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms\\' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson\\'s predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.\\n'\n",

      "Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.The government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week.Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay.Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week.He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week.But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday.\"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.\"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement.\"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\"The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\".The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma.\"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener.It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently.But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills.They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go.\"One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said.\"If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\"Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students.A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills.In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs.It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score.Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\".The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.\n",

      "b'Muslims discuss election concerns\\n\\nIssues that Muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by UK community representatives.\\n\\nThe event is being held by the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), which believes Muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections. But a spokesman stressed the meeting was \"not necessarily anti-Labour\". \"This meeting is not anti-party in particular, it\\'s anti-policy, it\\'s on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on,\" MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesday\\'s event.\\n\\n\"There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.\" Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.\\n\\nApproximately 1.1m of the UK\\'s 1.6m Muslims are of voting age. Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters.\\n\\nAnger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason, with many saying it was \"unjustified\". Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday\\'s event. Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The chairman of the MCB\\'s public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims\\' voting intentions. \"I think it\\'s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,\" Mr Khan said.\\n\\nHowever, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make. \"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there\\'s a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.\\n\\nThe constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001. In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour\\'s Lorna Fitzsimons. But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. \"Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,\" he said. But Dr Tamimi said MAB\\'s intention was not to \"empower\" the Tories. \"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly. \"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that\\'s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.\\n'\n",

      "Anger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason, with many saying it was \"unjustified\".Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday's event.Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).The chairman of the MCB's public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims' voting intentions.\"I think it's going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,\" Mr Khan said.However, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make.\"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there's a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added.In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001.In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour's Lorna Fitzsimons.But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.\"Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,\" he said.But Dr Tamimi said MAB's intention was not to \"empower\" the Tories.\"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly.\"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.\n",

      "b'Brown in appeal for Labour unity\\n\\nGordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.\\n\\nThe chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be \"diverted or distracted\" from tackling the challenges faced by the country. His only \"motivation\" was to ensure Labour was re-elected, he insisted. Mr Blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for Gordon Brown as old news. According to a new book, Brown\\'s Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.\\n\\nIn an interview with BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost, Mr Blair said: \"I\\'ve dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don\\'t do deals over jobs like this - you don\\'t. \"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\"\\n\\nIn a separate interview with BBC political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Brown said: \"It\\'s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government. \"I think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that I have. \"That is my purpose in politics, and that is what every day I seek to do. And I am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is Tony Blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip. \"The only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country.\" Mr Brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on Saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.\\n\\nBut Mr Peston said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other and that Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters\\' trust because of the Iraq war. He then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book. Andrew Marr said: \"This is enormously damaging. Gordon Brown knows it as well as Tony Blair. \"I think the relationship is genuinely, privately, very poor indeed. Things are very difficult.\" He added: \"Lots of ministers believe Tony Blair will attempt to move Gordon Brown out of the Treasury after the election. \"That depends on whether there\\'s still a Labour government and their majority.\"\\n\\nSenior MPs are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of Labour backbenchers on Monday.\\n\\nHealth Secretary John Reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging Labour\\'s re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven. Fresh speculation of a rift recently followed Mr Blair and Mr Brown\\'s separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair\\'s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other\\'s response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\". Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of\"squabbling like schoolboys\".

      "Gordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.The chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be \"diverted or distracted\" from tackling the challenges faced by the country.His only \"motivation\" was to ensure Labour was re-elected, he insisted.Mr Blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for Gordon Brown as old news.According to a new book, Brown's Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.In an interview with BBC One's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Blair said: \"I've dealt with this six months ago.I said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.\"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\"\n",
      "In a separate interview with BBC political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Brown said: \"It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government.\"That is my purpose in politics, and that is what every day I seek to do.And I am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is Tony Blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip.\"The only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country.\"Mr Brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on Saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.But Mr Peston said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other and that Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war.He then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.Andrew Marr said: \"This is enormously damaging.Gordon Brown knows it as well as Tony Blair.He added: \"Lots of ministers believe Tony Blair will attempt to move Gordon Brown out of the Treasury after the election.\"That depends on whether there's still a Labour government and their majority.\"\n",
      "Senior MPs are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of Labour backbenchers on Monday.Health Secretary John Reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging Labour's re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven.Fresh speculation of a rift recently followed Mr Blair and Mr Brown's separate responses to the Asian tsunami.These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa.There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster.But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\".Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of\"squabbling like schoolboys\".Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was \"getting in the way of good government\".\n",

      "People vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products, the Lib Dems say.Vincent Cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment.The Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue.He wants to see \"proper health checks\" when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.\"Were economic conditions to deteriorate at all, large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit,\" Mr Cable told BBC News.\"Banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead.\"Mr Cable said the government's Consumer Credit Bill would target some of the \"extreme problems\" such as loan sharking, but ministers had been \"a bit complacent\" about the wider issue of debt levels.He said much of the payment protection currently available was \"extremely expensive\" and there were \"lots of exclusions\".Mr Cable added that the Office of Fair Trading should investigate the market.Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the UK aimed at persuading voters his is the \"real opposition\".Mr Kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats, where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives, and urban areas traditionally associated with Labour.Labour say a Lib Dem vote could \"let the Tories in\", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean \"higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe\".Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May.\n",
      "The Liberal Democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and Labour, while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the Tories.Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in \"recent experience\".And he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in \"by the back door\".\"If you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections, the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the Conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government.\"That's going to be the story, I think, of this coming general election.\"\n",
